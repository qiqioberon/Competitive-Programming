**Competitive Programming Repository**

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Competitive Programming Repository! This repository serves as a collection of my C++ solutions to various programming problems sourced from online judges. While the majority of the solutions are from Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) at present, this repository aims to showcase my proficiency in competitive programming and serve as a valuable resource for interview preparation and skill demonstration.

**Contents:**
1. **Solutions:** This directory contains subdirectories organized by the name of the online judge platform. Within each subdirectory are the solutions to individual programming problems implemented in C++.

2. **README.md:** Provides an overview of the repository, including its purpose, contents, guidelines, and contact information.

**Purpose:**
The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate proficiency in competitive programming by showcasing solutions to various problem sets.
- Serve as a resource for interview preparation, allowing potential employers to assess my problem-solving skills and coding ability.
